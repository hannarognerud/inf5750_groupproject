[model] Filter models before getting the list.
Filtering can be done on modeldefinitions. This will interact with the api and get the requested items that match the filter.
These by default would adhere to the paging concept as default. 

[model] ModelCollection's pager should respect the previous applied filters.
When requesting next page or previous page on the api. Usually the filters are not present, the ModelCollection should respect the filters
as they were previously applied.

<!-- [model] Filtering on a ModelCollection result.
Filtering on a model collection result should filter the collection locally in memory without requesting from the api.?? -->
